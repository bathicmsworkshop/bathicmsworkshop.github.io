<h1>Overview and Aims</h1>

<p>As we enter the age of data we have seen the birth of machine learning methods to a diverse range of applications, including computer vision, classification/clustering, regression, data mining and prediction. Machine learning has been remarkably successful in applications but our theoretical understanding of many machine learning algorithms is still missing. This has led to an increasing appetite for the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms. Particularly exciting is the potential for methods from applied mathematics, probability theory, and statistics to contribute to machine learning theory.</p>

<p>The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers that apply mathematical methodology to machine learning.
We particularly want to emphasise how mathematical theory can inform applications and vice versa.</p>
